# HotelReservationFx

This project is an Online Hostel/Dorm Reservation System which allows users to book their bed/room in the dorm; this is an automated system where the user can search the availability of beds/rooms in the facility. The search can be done based on check-in/checkout dates. The beds/rooms that are available come with the status ‘available’, it will display all the beds/rooms available as of that search date. Once the room has been booked the user can cancel the reservation within 48 hours. And there is the concept of user login. As the user creates his/her own account with their email id, they can login into their account. There is an administrator login page for the administrator, who has the control over the system. The proposed system reduces a lot of effort for users and the administrator of the hostel/dorm as well.
